**# üìö AI-Powered Article and Page Summarizer**



Welcome to this project! This tool is designed to help you summarize very long articles and web pages efficiently using artificial intelligence.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



**## üöÄ What is this project about?**



This project leverages AI to create a \*\*tree-like structure\*\* of your articles and pages. Using this tree, you can:



\- Quickly navigate through different sections or nodes of your documents.

\- Read summaries of each section at various levels of detail.

\- Get an initial broad summary in the first paragraph.

\- Then progressively dive deeper into more detailed summaries down to a precise and well-structured conclusion.



This hierarchical summarization makes handling large volumes of content much easier and more intuitive.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



\## üõ†Ô∏è How does it work?



\- The tool uses AI to analyze and summarize web pages and articles.

\- It runs on \*\*Google Chrome\*\*, where it fetches and processes the content.

\- You must provide your own \*\*API key\*\* for the AI service (see below).



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





\## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions



1\. Open the file named `popup.gs`.

2\. At the very top (first line) of this file, enter your AI service API key like this:



&nbsp;  

javascript

&nbsp;  const API\_KEY = 'YOUR\_API\_KEY\_HERE';



3\. Save the file.





4\. Open Google Chrome and go to the Extensions page (chrome://extensions/).





5\. Enable Developer Mode by toggling the switch at the top right corner.





6\. Click Load unpacked and select the project folder to add this extension.





7\. After loading, you can activate the extension by clicking its icon at the top right of Chrome.





8\. Make sure to allow the extension to run on all websites and pages for it to function properly.
